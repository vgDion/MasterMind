# MasterMind 
This is the README file of the Mastermind project for GitHub testing

DISCLAIMER: this was an assignment in the first year, I was just starting to get acquainted with C. It was necessary to write a mastermind game using a list data structure. 
I had no experience with neither git, vim, nor the C standard.
